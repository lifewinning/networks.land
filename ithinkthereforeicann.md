## I Think Therefore ICANN

### Background

- Domain names make the internet a whole lot easier and a whole lot more fun, but the process that creates them entails a lot of weird complicated things
- It started, like a lot of things about how the internet works, as kind of an accident

### Types of TLDs

- "original" TLDs
	- domains created before ICANN (e.g. .com, .net, .mil)

- ccTLD
	- Definitions/Types
		- traditionally use 2 or 3-letter country codes for domains
			- 3-letter codes are reserved for future use but not all are currently in use (which is why no one can get the .and TLD)
		- internationalized (IDN) ccTLDS
			- use native language characters instead of Latin characters
			- not necessarily formal country abbreviations, can also be colloquial terms for countries ( e.g., the domain .السعودية is a colloquial short-form name for Saudi Arabia in Arabic)
	- Acquisition/creation process
		- Initially Jon Postel just used the ISO country-code standards and IANA accepted applications kind of on a goodwill basis, assuming people who represented countries actually did so (see .ly history for example of how this creates dilemmas)
		- ATM all the ISO codes are basically "reserved", to be implemented basically if/when a country representative requests
		- Internationalized ccTLDs processed through applications
	- Ownership/Management
		- can be managed by a national telecommunications authority
		- ...or "partner" with companies that manage the domain and pay out royalties to countries
			- .io, .ac, .sh -- Internet Computer Bureau
			- Verisign management of .tv
	- Political Incidents/Implications
		- the Internet Computer Bureau example--countries with complicated political status who continue to be unable to see the benefits of their domains
		- what happens when countries come apart? the .yu example when the former Yugoslavia fell apart
		- cultural/political clashes (vb.ly indcident and decency laws, Turkmenistan domains)
- gTLD
	- Definitions/Types
		- sponsored gTLD: represents a concept or term, non-geographic  
		- geographic gTLD
			- represents a geographic region or cultural identity
				- city/region (.nyc)
				- cultural identity (.cat)
				- places that might like more sovereignty than they have (.wales, .scot)
			- varied requirements w/r/t relationship to place
	- Acquisition process
	- Ownership
		- individual institutional stakeholders for very narrow, specific participants (.museum, .aero)
		- representatives of a regional/cultural concern (.cat)
		- colonial powers fucking over regional/cultural concerns (.wales)
		- large companies seeking general control over namespaces (e.g. Donuts just buying all the weird domains for all the things)
	- Political Incidents/Implications
		- what if your regional/cultural entity secedes? (.scot, .cat)
		- capacity to be used for straight trolling (.sucks)
		- what does it even mean to "own" these terms/phrases?

### Why People Buy Domains

- Political Application
- Commerce
- Brand Identity
- Domain hacks/Linguistic happenstance for example ".ly"
- Jokes (e.g. winafreebird.com means nothing but is also amazing?)

### Dilemmas for All Domains

- How do you price your domain?
- Are there uses you're not OK with? 
- IPv4 / IPv6 oh noes

### Gameplay notes

- Assumptions
	- fictional, blank slate--none of the countries are real, assumes completely open namespace
- How It Works: 
	- roles and particularities of players assigned to players based on dice throws, documented on paper character forms
	- during each player's turn in a round, they withdraw a situation card (color coded for their particular character) which either gives them a choice of action or just adds/takes away points. 
	- de facto points for all players
		- brands buying namespace gives everyone base set of points
		- "scarcity creep"--with each passing round players get a few more people acquiring domains from them simply because there are less and less cool phrases and domains available
	- if a gTLD player gets an "acquire domain" card and choose to submit an application for a new TLD, other players can contest the acquisition and the game goes to the domain auction. (basically a lightning round where auction participants try to buy the domain)
	- fun fact: the points are mostly meaningless, ICANN always wins 
- Available actions to players
	- ccTLD
		- representative agency for a country
			- apply for ccTLD
			- ban particular uses of TLDs based on national law
			- apply for and acquire internationalized ccTLDs
			- pursue domain hack-type purchases
			- shut down the internet in your own country
			- sell management of ccTLD to outside company (spend the rest of the game basically doing nothing and collecting a portion of sales/point acquisitions)
		- shady dealer "on behalf of" country
	- single-issue gTLD owner
		- nationalist gTLD
			- impose specific uses of the TLD
			- lead secessionist revolts to regain use of your domain
		- cultural/concept gTLD
			- impose specific uses of the TLD
			- contest gTLD hoarder purchases that are too similar to the domain/go to gTLD auction
			- apply for more related gTLDs/expand interests
	- gTLD hoarders
		- apply for more gTLDs
		- contest gTLDs/go to TLD auction
		- impose specific uses of TLDs
