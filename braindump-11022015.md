# Notes After Point Arena 

- Turnout: this is more a matter of "learning how to plan a thing" than a "learning how to build curricula"; for future workshopping mostly just thinking about more active work with institutions/organizations to lock in actual certain headcount, some structure, and understand the audience in greater depth

- Then again, it was weirdly kind of useful to jump in headfirst in some ways? Insofar as it was a cool way to learn that we actually do know how to improvise and we pretty much know what we're talking about. 

- Things that seemed to be really effective:
	- Drawing. (Not huge surprise, this is kind of textbook digital literacy stuff)
	- Sharks and buildings: that is to say, tangible examples that related to real things they could relate to or make jokes about. The cable helped too. 
	- Asking them to explain things back/asking "does that make sense?"
	- Having the fiber optic cable. Seriously. 

- Things that I didn't expect: 
	- The blocks were like, not appealing at all. Or they didn't gravitate toward them/seem to want to use them. But they may just have not been presented to them in a way that made them seem appealing--as in, not a thing they might actually want to use or were being expected to use. 
	- Of course no one wanted to write stuff down. Which may not be a matter of not doing the "write things down" thing, but maybe getting more specific (checklists?)

- Things that might be interesting to try in other workshops/variations: 
	- Depending on the size of the group, breaking students into teams with a set of blocks and asking them to put the network together
	- Making the expedition thing more like a homework assignment--i.e. "go home and do this" so instead of "make a collective map of infrastructure right here" it's "make a personal map of the infrastructure around you"

- Sticky wickets I am still thinking about:
	- The "you have $20 at the hardware store" version of the blocks--how do we make that? What does it look like? When I get back more likely will be able to experiment with pegboard/cardboard variations
	- Should probably provide a PDF or folder of images like the ones I used in that slide deck for Day 1 (good thing I have an endless supply of pictures of INFRASTRUCTURE)

# Notes After Radical Networks

- Things that seemed to be really effective:
	- They seemed to pretty much accept the super-didactic "we're just going to tell you a story" thing way more than I thought they would
	- Also loved how they got into their characters--no idea if that is specific to working with that audience, but realizing if you ask people to take on a role in a game they'll usually find a way to insert their own personality into that, no matter how little agency you really give them in the game. 

- Things that I didn't expect: 
	- Oh wow, I did not think about points allocation at all
	- Also need to make the player cards more helpful for documenting and doing maths
	- It's actually a really, really short game, and we could probably frontload with more introduction of things (like the ICANN applicant videos) if we really wanted

- Things to try in future iterations:
	- points allocation: roll 20 sided die, multiply by 100? Means you have between 100 and 2000 points, which is a pretty solid spread. 
	- Using a 20 sided die was mostly just good for laughs, but most people/schools don't just have those sitting around? Maybe just a matter of offering a breakdown of how to do points allocation based on different kinds of die available at your disposal. (Or, I guess, they just roll twice and take the sum of their two rolls and multiply by 100? I am not good at maths)

- Sticky wickets
	- For real though, will this be interesting or fun to anyone who isn't the type of person who shows up at a conference called "Radical Networks"? 
	- Internationalized TLDs not really brought up at all (the super Western-centric attitude of the whole ICANN system is a really relevant point); this may be a matter of doing more history/stories digging. Then again, that kind of gets into the history of Unicode and imperialism and maybe is scope creep?

# Notes For Future-Thinking Things

- We probably don't have time in the remainder of this grant to actually create or at least not field-test one more activity/module but I think we could maybe draft the parameters of one? Or do a very tiny thing in a workshopping context  

- Topics/Modules we could conceivably draft within the next 2.5 months/have enough to start with that it could work
	- Wireless--kids seem to all already assume the internet moves through the air, so maybe explaining how that actually works is a good call? 
	- Protocol--various levels of how to do this; packets and streams seem like the lowest-hanging fruit, thinking of the thing with the nested boxes we did at SFPC and/or some of the earlier discussions of obstacle courses etc. 
	- History pieces? IDK


- The Actual Goddamn Website
	- OK we need to do this.
	- Things that probably make sense to do: 
		- Individual sections for specific curricula material per module
		- Glossary/wiki of All The Terms used across modules in one place
		- Media resources (pictures of kinds of infrastructure for slides, links to extra-great videos, etc)
		- Handout resources
