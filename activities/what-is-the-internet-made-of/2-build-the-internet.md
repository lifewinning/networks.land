## Part 2: Let's Build the Internet

*Objective: Understand how different objects that make up the internet connect to each other and that the internet is a **network of networks***

**Materials**

- Network modeling kit:
	- Set of modular wooden blocks that can be used as "nodes" of the network
	- Photos on small pieces of card stock of different pieces of internet infrastructure that can be interchangeably attached to the blocks
	- String or cable used to connect the blocks together
- Handout on how the network actually works
- Projector (if available)

**Activities**

- Recap from Part 1 activities: what did students see when they went looking for the internet (either with the class or on their own?) (10-15 minutes)

- Break students into small groups and give them each a set of blocks, cables, and images from the network modeling kit. Their objective is to take the different types of objects in the kit and make a model of how the different objects fit together to send a message from one personal computer to another.

- Each group will have slightly different ratios of objects (some might have more antennae than cables, some might have satellite uplinks, etc.) but all will have at least 2 personal computer objects to connect together. Instructors will walk around during this process to give feedback and ask students to explain how their network works. (30-45 minutes)

- Once each group has finished, introduce a new challenge: getting all the group's networks to talk to each other. This is where you can introduce the **carrier hotel** or **internet exchange**, the building where all the different parts of the internet meet up to trade data. (10-15 minutes)

- Using the projector, show how it's possible to see this transmission of data across the physical network with a traceroute. Lead discussion on how the network was built/how it got there, who owns it, and what happens when it breaks (15-25 minutes).
