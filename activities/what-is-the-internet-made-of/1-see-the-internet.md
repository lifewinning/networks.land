title:  Introduction to Seeing the Internet
category: activities
---

*Objective: Understand that the internet is **made up of physical objects in the world**, and be able to identify those objects in the world*

**Materials**: 

- pad of 18x24 drawing paper (newsprint or butcher paper is fine)
- Markers
- Walls to put up drawings and write notes
- Handouts detailing different examples of internet infrastructure

**Activities**

- Ask students the following questions about the internet. Write some key words from their answers on a sheet of 18x24 paper. (5-10 minutes)
	- What is the internet?
	- What do use the internet for?
	- What do you think happens behind the scenes when you're using the internet? How does a webpage or an application end up on the screen you're looking at?

- Have students work in small groups (3-4) to make drawings illustrating their answers to that last question about how the internet works. (15-20 minutes)

- Each group takes 3-5 minutes to present their drawings of the internet to the class. Hang the drawings on the wall. (15-20 minutes) 

- Give a short presentation on the different real-world objects that make up the internet (routers, cables, antennae, data centers, and more), showing pictures and examples of things that students might encounter out on the street or in their homes if they went looking for the internet. Give them handouts with a breakdown of these different objects to look for (10 minutes)

- **Optional: Field Trip!** Take the students for a walk to look for some examples of the internet that they might run into on the street. The success of this activity kind of depends on whether the area you're in has lots of relevant things to look at/for, scouting out the workshop location is kind of crucial here (30-45 minutes).

- **Alternative: Assignment** If you're in an area that doesn't have many cool signs of internet infrastructure, ask students to go home and look for some examples at or around their home, or on their way to school the next day. If they can take pictures of what they see, bring them in. If not, take notes on the handouts given. Students should be prepared to talk about what they saw the next day. Instructor should be prepared to do the same thing.
