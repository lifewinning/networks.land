## Part 3: Let's *Be* The Internet

*Objective: Understand how data is transmitted through that network of networks to your computer via **packet switching*** and understand the components of the HTTP header. 

**Materials**

- Packet switching relay kit
	- Sets of nested boxes (or folded paper, or envelopes) representing different parts of an HTTP request. In the final box, there's a piece of a jigsaw puzzle. 
- 3 tables
- Projector (if available)
- Handout with list of resources for learning more outside this workshop

**Activities**

- Recap from Part 2: how do all the parts of the network talk to each other? (5-10 minutes)

- Going back to Part 1's question of *How does a webpage or an application end up on the screen you're looking at?*, explain how the traceroute example simplifies things a little bit--when you open a webpage, it's not exactly one thing that's loading on the screen, it's a whole bunch of little things that are coming from lots of different places and they all take different paths to your computer. (10-15 minutes)

- Show students one of the nested boxes. The boxes represent different pieces of information that indicate where the box needs to go and where the box is coming from. They have to sort through the boxes on the table and read their different labels to figure out where each one belongs. Once all the boxes have been sorted, students can open up the final layer of boxes, which hold puzzle pieces. (20-30 minutes)

- **Optional/maybe a bad idea**: Do we want to bother introducing cookies? Impulse is TOTALLY YES RAD, but I'm not entirely sure how that should work.

- We've just re-enacted what happens when you load a webpage! Well, kind of. Use projector and slides to explain TCP/IP and HTTP, background and history of how it became a thing, why it's cool, and what's different about it now. (20-30 minutes)

- Going back to Part 1's drawings of how we thought the internet worked, lead discussion of how the ideas we had before were the same as what we've learned and how they're different. Distribute handout with more resources for students if they want to learn more after this workshop! (15-20 minutes)
