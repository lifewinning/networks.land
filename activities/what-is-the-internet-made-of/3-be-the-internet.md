So this game is pretty silly, but surprisingly fun?

*Objective: Understand how data is transmitted through that network of networks to your computer via **packet switching*** and understand the components of the HTTP header. 

### Materials

- Packet switching relay kit
	- Two sets of at least 24 different sized envelopes (your mileage may vary)
	- At least three different maximum 12-piece puzzles (again, your mileage may vary)
		- We bought blank 12-piece puzzles [here](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00598K8H8/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_q49Twb0ZD0PMQ)
		- ![blocks](/assets/objects-1.JPG){:.img-responsive}
- 3 tables

### Activities

- Look at an example of a traceroute to show how visiting a website actually involves "hopping" across servers throughout the network. But the traceroute example simplifies things a little bit--when you open a webpage, it's not exactly one thing that's loading on the screen, it's a whole bunch of little things that are coming from lots of different places and they all take different paths to your computer. (10-15 minutes)

- Show students one of the "packet envelopes". These represent different pieces of information and indicate where the packet needs to go and where the packet is coming from. Students have to sort through the packets on the table and read their different labels to figure out where each one belongs on the other side of the room. Once all the packets have been sorted, students can open up the final layer of packets, which hold puzzle pieces. (20-30 minutes)

- **Optional/maybe a bad idea**: It would be theoretically possible to try and incorporate other interesting facets of the HTTP header, like cookies, into these packets. But this may be more than we can actually handle at this moment.

- We've just re-enacted what happens when you load a webpage! Well, kind of. Lecture part explaining TCP/IP and HTTP, background and history of how it became a thing, why it's cool, and what's different about it now. (20-30 minutes)
