##Network Geography 
###Lesson 1 - Draw the internets

- Start off with what learning from  students what they think the internet looks like. Doing so can help understand the assumptions people are coming to this workshop with. It also helps draw a before and after comparison

*I thought I knew what the internet was...*

- ####Questions
	- What is the internet?
	- What do use the internet for?
	- Who do you think happens behind the scenes when your browser loads a webpage?
- ####Activity
	- In groups of 3-5, draw the Internet. This opening exercise is free-form: write or draw anything to best communicate what you think the Internet looks like. (10-15 minutes)
	- Each group takes 5 minutes to present their drawings of the internet to the class. Put these drawings on display to refer back over the course of the workshop. (10-15 minutes)
- #####Materials
	 - Roll Paper
	 - Colored pens + pencils
	 - Bulletin or display board + pins

	- 	After going through the questions and activities, clarify how the physical objects that make up the internet work together
	- The presenation includes information about fiber optic cables, cell towers,  
	- #####Objects
  		- Routers/Modems	
	 	- Wifi Networks		
	  	- Antennae
 		- Cellphone and microwave towers are a common part of communications infrastructure. When you start looking for them you will notice them everywhere.
	 	- Fiber Optic Cables *Internet follows roads*
