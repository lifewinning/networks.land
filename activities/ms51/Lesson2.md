##Network Geography
###Lesson 2 - See the internet


- This is the part of the workshop where they will see how the physical objects that make up the internet work together. It is a good idea to scout around before hand and find nearby places where there is a good variety of infrastructure. The list of objects falls under 6 broad categories. 
- Students should come in with stuff they found in their neighbourhoods/houses that are realted to the internet.
