## Description of your talk / panel / workshop / demo
[Description goes here. Try to keep it under 300 words, but more than 140 characters. Note that panels should follow a moderator / discussion format, with possible participation from the audience.]

I guess this is where we have to decide what the thing we actually do is. It depends a bit on what we want the takeaway to be. What ideas are worth regurgitating? How much live coding should there be?

If we're doing a coding thing I feel like it could be interesting to do a walk through of how packet gets from one place to another and what it actually says about where its going, what data its carrying, what we can infer from it based on the different layers (IP,PORT,HTTP, HTTPS,UDP) etc. 

Thinking about it, might be fun to actually have some precrafed pcaps that we can get them all to run through(somehow?). As a way to focus on the the details that help navigate the mental models. Like we can have a packet going to bobby.horse. And then ask the question: Who owns bobby.horse? The answer (I just checked) is no one. We should buy it and make it something funny. We then make them do a whois lookup and talk about what icann is, the challaneges of ipv4,v6 or even TLDs or mesh networks.

Im not super attached to any of this, but just want to put down what Im thinking so you know where I'm coming from.
The above example is probably too simplistic, but I think the format of us navigating them through a topic is a good way to go.


Another thing is  when you start playing with networks one of the biggest early barriers of entry is the speed of the network. slowing things down might make it more fun. Again, need to think more about what to slow down.
