# Network Geography 101 Demo Day Presentation Notes

- The project is: curriculum and make teaching tools for explaining how the internet works at a physical, technical, and political level

- Hypothesis: there is something missing in between digital literacy and code literacy, and people don't even know they want to know about this stuff. 

- Approach: make some games and activities, test it out on students of varying ages and backgrounds

- Observations:
	- This knowledge is lacking at pretty much every age range and skill level. 
		- Sample responses to being asked what the internet is and how it works: "It's a search engine" (9-year-old), "Pixels live inside my computer" (10-year-old), "I have absoutely no idea" (the US managing editor of the *Financial Times*), "Elves?" (Ramsey, who was kind of joking but actually not really joking), 
		- "People in Congress don't know how this stuff works" (Frank, policy person working at D&S)
	- Stories > Technical breakdowns and Objects > Screens
		- A submarine cable isn't cool to children. You know what's cool? A submarine cable being eaten by a SHARK.
		- "Hands on" isn't always the most important thing when dealing with an esoteric topic--people are OK with being led through a narrative as long as it's told well (TLD game) and models can be useful as things to look at as much as they can be useful for activities (network blocks)
		- Being able to show people actual stuff in the world--in their world, especially--was really, really helpful. That's one of the things that made Point Arena a super appealing place to test some of this material.
	- We initially faltered by focusing more on students than teachers--at the end of the day, success is actually when *other* people are able to teach this stuff, not when we can get students to pay attention to it. 

- What We Made
	- Activities/Objects
		- Network Blocks
			- Tools for modeling how different pieces of network infrastructure talk to each other
		- Packet Puzzle
			- Exercise to teach students about packet-switching and encapsulation, using envelopes and puzzle pieces
		- I Think Therefore ICANN
			- Lecture about internet governance and global conflict, disguised as a card game
	- Documentation and Reference Material (Surya and I have been writing explainer documents about key concepts and objects, more specifically as reference material for educators)

- Things that are happening next:
	- Focus our efforts more on working with teachers than with students--our expertise is this subject matter, not pedagogy (e.g., handing off the material to Ramsey to test on his grad students)
	- Upcoming workshop with LEAP-NYC

- "We have secured partnerships/funding/participation"
	- I'm not sure I totally understand this one--should we just list who we worked with? Or who we're going to work with?
	- i.e. working with LEAP NYC, we're probably going to have continued support from D&S (if not funding then at least a home for it/place to funnel more grants), still need to email Erica at Eyebeam but am optimistic, IDK if anything came of that Disk Cactus-Exploratorium meeting? 

- Suggestions for others working through similar problems
	- Don't take your own expertise for granted
	- Don't assume your politics are baked into the content--and don't be afraid to do that
	- If you're not having fun with the material no one will have fun with the material
