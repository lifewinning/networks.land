Information: in thinking about Shannon and information. basically the first mental model to think about is that information theory is all about the quantification of the amount of 'Information' in a given object. The reason I find this notion fascination is because understanding how much of something there is is an important non trivial step in being able to manipulate and control it. </div><div><br></div><div>2. once they figured out how much of something there is, it was possible to start thinking about how much redundancy also existed within that system. Find an example that reflects this idea well. Once you know how much redundancy there is you can start thinking about how to reduce it to make transmitting that thing easier</div><div><br></div><div>3. The Information Age and transition from digital to analog allowed things to be manipulate in ways that wasn't possible before. this is where packet switching come in. Maybe watch cosmos again to find good examples of science that did that too. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>4. mappings: thinking about h</div></div></div>
