##Network Geography
	

Hello! 
This document is intended for someone who is planning on running the network geography workshop. 

The goal of this workshop is to make participants better aware of the physical geography of the things that make up the digital space we all inhabit.

Many of us use the internet everyday without a basic understanding of the topology and actors in the network. While this knowledge isn't essential for using the internet, having it can enable richer participation and better informed decision making.


The workshop consists of three seperate modules. 
The first iteration of this workshop ran for 3 days. Each day had a 2 hour session. 

###Draw the internet
- Start off with what learning from  participants what they think the internet looks like. Doing so can help understand the assumptions people are coming to this workshop with. It also helps draw a before and after comparison
- ####Questions
	- What is the internet?
	- What do you use the internet for?
	- What kind of internet do you have?
- ####Activity
	- In groups of 3-5, draw the Internet. This opening exercise is free-form: write or draw anything to best communicate what you think the Internet looks like. (10-15 minutes)
	- Each group takes 5 minutes to present their drawings of the internet to the class. Put these drawings on display to refer back over the course of the workshop. (10-15 minutes)
	- #####Materials
		- Roll Paper
		- Colored pens + pencils
		- Bulletin or display board + pins

###See the internet
- In this session participants will go outside and find things. This is the part of the workshop where they will see the physical objects that make up the internet. It is a good idea to scout around before hand and find nearby places where there is a good variety of infrastructure. The list of objects falls under 6 broad categories.
- ####Objects
 	- Antennae
 		- Cellphone and microwave towers are a common part of communications infrastructure. When you start looking for them you will notice them everywhere. 	
 	- Fiber Optic Cables
 	- Flags
 	- Manhole Covers
 	- Spray paint
 	- Routers/Modems	
 	- Wifi Networks	
 	
- At the start of the session introduce these objects and the role they play. How many do people recognise. How many did they think are part of the internet.
 - ####Activity
 	- Now that you have provided a list of things that make up the internet. Take the participants outside to go see it for themselves. Get outside and observe the landscape.
 	- #####Materials
 		- Logbook
 	
 			- We have made a logbook for this activity that you can download and print out **here ADD LINK** . Ideally you should print them double sided.
 			- The logbook has individual sections for each of the objects with some images and a brief description of what to look for.
	 	- Cameras
	 		- Encourage people to take pictures of the stuff they see as that will be helpful for the final session. 
 		
 		 	

###Build a model based of the internet
 - On the most basic layer , the internet is about objects and their relationship to each other and their environments. The focus of this session is to consolidate the observations from the previous day to see how those objects fit within the larger topology of the internet.
- ####Questions
	- What did you see? Discuss the observations students made in their logbooks.
	- Could you differentiate betweeon internet and other infrastructure? If so, how?
	- How is the infrastructure affected by the natural + human made landscape?
- ####Activity 
 	- Use the information collected by participants to model the local infrastructure landscape.
 	- **THIS IS MORE SPECIFIC TO PA**
 	- #####Materials
	 	- Network Blocks
	 	- Print 2 copies of the images people took and place them on card stock
	 	- Place the card stock on network blocks
	 	- Connect them together.
