This is intended as a broad overview of different types of physical objects and infrastructure that make up the internet. There are longer, more in-depth overviews of each of these infrastructural elements, but this is mainly for having a big-picture view.

# Routers

For most people, this is where access to the internet starts. Well, technically it starts at a computer, tablet, or smart phone, and it starts with a wi-fi connection. Wifi signals travel through the air, usually between a device (like a computer or a phone) and a router. Traditionally, that router connects back to the internet via an Ethernet cable. Sometimes that Ethernet cable is connected to a modem that connects either to what would be a TV cable (coaxial) or a phone line. 

**tk tk I don't actually own a router because I am bad and should feel bad, will go look at one to better document this**

# Cables

The internet actually *is* a series of tubes. While the Although most people's interactions with the internet happen over a wireless connection, that connection always goes back to a wire. Let's say you're connecting via a wifi connection from a router. That router is wired into a cable network. If you're connected to the internet via a smart phone using a data plan, then the wireless signal is coming from a cell tower. Cell towers are also wired into a cable network, but it's usually made of fiber-optic cable. In both cases, those wired connections on the router and the cell tower send your internet activity back into a global network made mostly of cable. 

## Types of Cable

- **Copper:** Originally used for telegraphy and telephone communications starting in the 1880s. It's used less and less for internet connections today, partly because it can't carry as much information as newer types of cable.
 
- **Coaxial:** A coaxial cable still has a copper conductor, but is more insulated and more efficient than older copper wires. Itâ€™s commonly used for cable television connections. A lot of residential buildings still rely on coaxial connections, connecting up to fiber networks in utility cabinets on the street or underground. 

- **Fiber:** Optical fibers are transparent strands of glass that transmit data as pulses of light. It offers a far faster speeds and greater bandwidth for transmitting information than copper and coaxial. It's been a part of large-scale telecommunications infrastructure since the 1970s, but fiber connections to residential buildings (the so-called "last mile" connection) have only really emerged in the last decade or so, partly due to consumer demand for higher speeds and partly due to the dropping cost of fiber itself. 

## Where Cable Lives

- **Above the Ground**: Sometimes fiber optic cables run along the same posts as telephone lines. Although they tend to just look like thick black cables, one easy way to recognize them is to look for big black cylinders handing along the cables. These are **optical repeaters**, which are basically devices that turn
