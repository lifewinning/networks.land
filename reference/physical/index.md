This is intended as a broad overview of different types of physical objects and infrastructure that make up the internet. There are longer, more in-depth overviews of each of these infrastructural elements, but this is mainly for having a big-picture view of how they work. For more information on different companies and who owns some of this stuff, refer to the section "Who Owns The Internet?"

# Routers

For most people, this is where access to the internet starts. Well, technically it starts at a computer, tablet, or smart phone, and it starts with a wi-fi connection. Wifi signals travel through the air, usually between a device (like a computer or a phone) and a router. Traditionally, that router connects back to the internet via an Ethernet cable. Sometimes that Ethernet cable is connected to a modem that connects either to what would be a TV cable (coaxial) or a phone line. 

**tk tk I don't actually own a router because I am bad and should feel bad, will go look at one to better document this**

# Cables

The internet actually *is* a series of tubes. While the Although most people's interactions with the internet happen over a wireless connection, that connection always goes back to a wire. Let's say you're connecting via a wifi connection from a router. That router is wired into a cable network. If you're connected to the internet via a smart phone using a data plan, then the wireless signal is coming from a cell tower. Cell towers are also wired into a cable network, but it's usually made of fiber-optic cable. In both cases, those wired connections on the router and the cell tower send your internet activity back into a global network made mostly of cable. 

## Types of Cable

- **Copper:** Originally used for telegraphy and telephone communications starting in the 1880s. It's used less and less for internet connections today, partly because it can't carry as much information as newer types of cable.
 
- **Coaxial:** A coaxial cable still has a copper conductor, but is more insulated and more efficient than older copper wires. Itâ€™s commonly used for cable television connections. A lot of residential buildings still rely on coaxial connections, connecting up to fiber networks in utility cabinets on the street or underground. 

- **Fiber:** Optical fibers are transparent strands of glass that transmit data as pulses of light. It offers a far faster speeds and greater bandwidth for transmitting information than copper and coaxial. It's been a part of large-scale telecommunications infrastructure since the 1970s, but fiber connections to residential buildings (the so-called "last mile" connection) have only really emerged in the last decade or so, partly due to consumer demand for higher speeds and partly due to the dropping cost of fiber itself. 

## Where Cable Lives and How To Spot It

- **Above the Ground**: These are cables that hang from utility poles. Although they tend to just look like thick black cables, one way to recognize them is to look for big black cylinders or boxes handing along the cables. These are **amplifiers**, which are basically devices that convert the cable's signal from optical to electrical, and then back into optical. This is done because of something called **attenuation**. It refers to the way that information transmitted over a long distance deteriorates over time (think of the difference between shouting something across a really big field and shouting to someone right next to you--as the sound travels, it becomes harder to hear). Converting the signal from one form back into its original form reduces that attenuation. 
 
- **Below the Ground**: A lot of cables are buried underground in ducts, which means they aren't always that easy to see. But there are a lot of things that happen just above buried cables that can help you find it.  
	- **Points of Entry**: Since repairpeople have to be able to access cables, there are a few things that are pretty easy to spot on the street that can help you find the internet. 
		- **Junction Boxes**: These are basically the block-level switching points for home cable connections. Within these boxes are thousands of wires and cables for telephone, television, and internet, all coming from nearby buildings. In the junction box, those cables get connected to terminals that are themselves spliced into the underground cable network, sending whatever data you've transmitted via a wifi connection to the global internet network
		- **Manhole Covers**: These are entry points to underground ducts. The pattern and design or name of the company listed on the manhole cover can give some indication of what's buried underneath or who owns whatever is buried there. Typical generic manholes in the U.S. feature a hexagonal pattern and either a bell logo or the logo of some other internet company in the center. Sometimes these manholes will also just say something super-generic, like "Communications."  
	- **Utility Markers**: These different markers and labels are usually meant to be temporary indicators of buried utilities, not permanent labels. Whenever construction companies or city workers have to cut open roads or fields for construction, they have to call a central service (811) so they can find out what's already buried in the spot they're going to dig up. 811 tells all the utilities and companies that have things buried underground to go label their things before the new construction work happens. That way, the people doing the construction don't end up knocking out a power line or your internet connection by mistake. All of these markings are color-coded for specific kinds of utilities. Orange is for all telecommunications. 
		- **Cable Posts or Flags**: These are not commonly seen in dense cities, but they are very common along highways and railroads and more suburban areas. They often have the name of a company (maybe who owns the cable or sometimes which contractor located the cable for them) and a phone number (either 811, the number of the locating company, or the number of the cable owner).
		- **Spray paint**: These tend to have less detailed information than flags or posts, but depending on the city you're in you can use them to figure out who owns a particular cable.

# Antennae

Although cables form the foundation of most of the network, more and more of an average person's usage of the internet happens over a mobile connection. That connection travels via an antenna. There are a few different types of antennae that are good to look for if you're trying to look for the internet on the street. 

## Types of Antennae

- **Cellular antenna**: These are the types of antenna that most people are likely to interact with on a day-to-day basis. **TK TK how cell towers work**

- **Microwave antenna**: These are used for what's called **point-to-point** communication, which works kind of like a relay system. When one antenna in the microwave network receives a signal, it passes that signal on to the next nearest antenna, which
